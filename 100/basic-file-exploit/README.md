# basic-file-exploit

### Description

The program provided allows you to write to a file and read what you wrote from it. Try playing around with it and see if you can break it!

### Resources

- Endpoint: nc saturn.picoctf.net 49698
- program-redacted.c

### Solution

Using <kbd>CTRL+f</kbd> I looked through the source code given in the program-redacted.c for where the term 'flag' is used. I noticed it was used inside of the data_read function.

![data_read](./data_read_function.png)

The function works using the following logic to give the flag:
1. Enter the entry number of the data you would like to read.
2. With the entry number, convert it to a long value with given base 10
3. Conversion must equal 0!

Using the endpoint, trying to access the second option resulted in the following output.

![program-echo-response](./program-echo-response.png)

Therefore, it was necessary to input data before I could access this option. 

Then:
