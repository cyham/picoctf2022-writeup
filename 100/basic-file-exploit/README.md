### Solution

Using <kbd>CTRL+f</kbd> I looked through the source code given in the program-redacted.c for where the term 'flag' is used. I noticed it was used inside of the data_read function.

![data_read](./data_read_function.png)

The function works using the following logic to give the flag:
1. Enter the entry number of the data you would like to read.
2. Convert the entry number to a long value with given base 10.
3. If the converted number is equal to zero, then output the flag.

Using the endpoint to try and access the second option resulted in the following output.

![program-echo-response](./program-echo-response.png)

Therefore, it was necessary to use the first option and enter data into the database before I could access this option. 

Then:
